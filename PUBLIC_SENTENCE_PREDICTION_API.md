### Request fields

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `drugs` | Yes | One or more drug entries. |
| `drugs[].type` | Yes | Drug type listed below. |
| `drugs[].quantity` | Yes | Quantity in grams. Must be greater than zero. |
<!-- | `drugs[].variant` | Conditional | Required only for `Midazolam`. | -->
| `defendantRole` | No | One defendant role, or `null`. |
| `additionalCircumstances` | No | Additional circumstance list. |
| `guiltyPlea` | No | One guilty-plea option, or `null` when unknown. |
| `aggravatingFactors` | No | Aggravating-factor list. |
| `mitigatingFactors` | No | Mitigating-factor list. |
| `startingPointMode` | No | `notional-weighted` (default) or `multi-drug-floor`. |

If omitted, `additionalCircumstances`, `aggravatingFactors`, and `mitigatingFactors` are treated as empty lists, `guiltyPlea` defaults to `null`, and `startingPointMode` defaults to `notional-weighted`.

## Drug types

Accepted values for `drugs[].type` are:

- `Cocaine`
- `Ketamine`
- `Fluorodeschloroketamine`
- `Methamphetamine`
- `Heroin`
- `Cannabis/THC`
- `Ecstasy`
- `Midazolam`
- `Nimetazepam`

`Fluorodeschloroketamine` is accepted as a Ketamine-equivalent type.

<!-- For `Midazolam`, `variant` is required and must be `powder`:

```json
{
  "type": "Midazolam",
  "quantity": 2,
  "variant": "powder"
}
```

`tablet` is not accepted. Midazolam quantities are sent in grams of narcotic weight and follow the powder guidelines.

No `variant` field is required for other drug types. -->

## Starting point model

The drug-based starting point uses the bucketed sentencing-guideline interpolation. Each drug family has a series of quantity bands (in grams) with a sentence range; a quantity is mapped to its band and interpolated linearly across the band's sentence range. Open-ended top bands predict the band floor, and the "at the sentencer's discretion" band predicts the previous band's ceiling.

For a request with several drugs the starting point uses the notional-quantity method: for each drug, take the sentence the *total* quantity would attract in that drug's family, weight it by that drug's share of the total quantity, and sum the contributions. The `Multiple Drugs` aggravating factor is only applied when explicitly included in `aggravatingFactors`; it is never selected automatically.

Setting `startingPointMode` to `multi-drug-floor` instead requires the starting point to clear the most serious single drug or guideline group, so that additional drugs can only maintain or increase it. Drugs sentenced on the same tariff table are aggregated first: `Cocaine` with `Heroin`, and `Ketamine` with `Ecstasy` and `Nimetazepam` (`Fluorodeschloroketamine` uses the Ketamine table). The response then includes a `startingPointBreakdown` with the baseline, the provisional notional-quantity sentence, and the uplift applied:

```text
baselineMonths    = max over guideline groups of the group's sentence
provisionalMonths = notional-quantity sentence over all drugs
upliftMonths      = max(0, provisionalMonths − baselineMonths)
startingPoint     = baselineMonths + upliftMonths
```

The response reports these values rounded to two decimal places, with `upliftMonths` derived from the rounded `startingPointMonths` and `baselineMonths` rather than rounded on its own. `baselineMonths + upliftMonths` therefore gives back `startingPointMonths` at the published precision, and an uplift of `0` always means the baseline was the binding sentence.

When `upliftMonths` is `0`, the additional drugs added nothing through the quantity formula and their presence is reflected only through the `Multiple Drugs` aggravating factor, which the caller must still select explicitly. For a single drug, or for drugs that all fall inside one guideline group, both modes return the same starting point.

## Defendant roles

Accepted values for `defendantRole` are:

- `Courier / Storekeeper`
- `Actual trafficker`
- `Manager / Organiser`
- `Operator / Financial Controller`

Only one role may be selected.

The only accepted value for `additionalCircumstances` is:

- `Cross-border trafficking`

`Divan keeping` and `Manufacturing` are not accepted values.

## Guilty plea options

`guiltyPlea` is optional and must be one of, or `null` when the plea is unknown:

- `null`
- `Plead not guilty`
- `Plead guilty (earliest opportunity)`
- `Plead guilty (before trial dates are set)`
- `Plead guilty (before trial starts)`
- `Plead guilty (first day of trial)`
- `Plead guilty (during the trial)`

## Aggravating factors

Accepted values for `aggravatingFactors` are:

- `Multiple Drugs`
- `Persistent offender`
- `On bail`
- `Refugee/Asylum`
- `Use of minors`
## Mitigating factors

Accepted values for `mitigatingFactors` are:

- `Self-consumption`
- `Assistance - limited`
- `Assistance - useful`
- `Assistance - testify`
- `Assistance - risk`
- `Young offender`
- `Medical conditions` (To be Removed)
- `Family illness` (To be Removed)
- `Rehabilitation programme`

Only one assistance option may be selected. `Extreme youth` is not accepted.

}
```

### Response fields

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | `supported` when a prediction is returned. |
| `startingPointMode` | Starting point method used: `notional-weighted` or `multi-drug-floor`. |
| `startingPointBreakdown` | Present for `multi-drug-floor`, `null` otherwise. |
| `startingPointBreakdown.baselineMonths` | Sentence for the most serious single drug or guideline group. |
| `startingPointBreakdown.provisionalMonths` | Notional-quantity sentence over all drugs. |
| `startingPointBreakdown.upliftMonths` | `max(0, provisionalMonths − baselineMonths)`. |
| `startingPointBreakdown.groups` | One entry per guideline group, most serious first, with `guidelineGroup`, `family`, `drugTypes`, `quantity`, and `startingPointMonths`. |
| `startingPointMonths` | Starting point in months. |
| `startingPointYears` | Starting point in years. |
| `adjustments` | Adjustments for selected roles and factors. |
| `adjustments[].factor` | Role, factor, or plea option applied. |
| `adjustments[].category` | `defendantRole`, `aggravating`, `mitigating`, or `guiltyPlea`. |
| `adjustments[].direction` | `increase` or `decrease`. |
| `adjustments[].percentage` | Percentage used by the model. |
| `adjustments[].baseMonths` | Sentence amount to which the adjustment was applied. |
| `adjustments[].months` | Adjustment amount in months. |
| `adjustments[].years` | Adjustment amount in years. |
| `finalSentenceMonths` | Final predicted sentence in months. |
| `finalSentenceYears` | Final predicted sentence in years. |

Adjustment amounts are returned as positive values. Use `direction` to determine whether an amount is added or reduced.

Adjustments are non-compounding within each stage. Role increases are each calculated against the unchanged starting point and summed to form the post-role sentence; aggravating increases are each calculated against that post-role sentence and summed to form the notional sentence; reductions (mitigating factors and the guilty plea) are each calculated against the notional sentence and summed, then the total reduction is subtracted once.

## Example request

```bash
curl -X POST https://example.com/api/sentence-predictions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "drugs": [
      {"type": "Ketamine", "quantity": 20}
    ],
    "defendantRole": "Courier / Storekeeper",
    "additionalCircumstances": ["Cross-border trafficking"],
    "guiltyPlea": "Plead not guilty",
    "aggravatingFactors": [],
    "mitigatingFactors": []
  }'
```

```

The request body is identical to the sentence-prediction request above. All request fields, drug types, roles, plea options, and factor rules apply unchanged.

### Successful response

Status: `200 OK`

```json
[
  {
    "neutralCitation": "[2024] HKDC 1502",
    "title": "HKSAR v Chan Kwok Ming",
    "url": "https://www.hklii.hk/en/cases/hkdc/2024/1502",
    "score": 1
  },
  {
    "neutralCitation": "[2023] HKDC 536",
    "title": "HKSAR v Wong Wai Shing",
    "url": "https://www.hklii.hk/en/cases/hkdc/2023/536",
    "score": 0.9955
  }
]
```

### Response fields

The response is a JSON array of case objects.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `neutralCitation` | Neutral citation of the judgment. |
| `title` | Case title. |
| `url` | Link to the English or Chinese version of the judgment. |
| `score` | Similarity to the submitted facts, between 0 and 1. |

The `score` is a weighted combination: `0.8 × drug-profile similarity + 0.2 × starting-point similarity`. The drug-profile component compares the quantity of every requested drug family against the case (a missing drug family scores zero) and is diluted by any additional drug family present in the case but not requested. The starting-point component compares the two sentencing starting points, using the method selected by `startingPointMode`; choosing a different mode therefore changes the scores and can reorder the returned cases or push borderline cases below the `0.6` cutoff.

Cases must contain every requested drug family to be returned.

Up to 10 cases are returned, sorted by `score` in descending order. Cases with a `score` below 0.6 are excluded.

## Client guidance

- Send quantities in grams.
- Use the exact enum spelling and capitalization documented above.
- Do not send duplicate factor values.
- Do not send `variant` for non-Midazolam drugs.
- Treat `422` as an unavailable prediction, not as a client retry condition.
- Treat `429` as temporary and retry only after applying backoff.
